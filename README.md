OpenEye is a Python-based forensic tool designed to help users discover and analyze publicly accessible CCTV camera feeds using Google Dork queries. The tool allows users to search for live camera feeds, test the links for accessibility, and fetch metadata such as WHOIS information and geolocation data. It also provides the ability to open the camera feed in a web browser and view its location on Google Maps.

Features
1) Google Dork Search: Execute predefined or custom Google Dork queries to find publicly accessible CCTV camera feeds.
2) Link Testing: Automatically test the discovered links to verify if they are accessible and match public CCTV patterns.
3) Metadata Extraction: Fetch and display metadata for selected camera feeds, including:
4) WHOIS information (domain, IP address, registrar, domain age).
5) Geolocation data (country, city, latitude, longitude).
6) Open in Browser: Open the selected camera feed in your default web browser.
7) Google Maps Integration: View the geolocation of the camera feed on Google Maps.
